<h1>Nara's Favorite TV shows</h1>
<h2>Top 3 TV shows through my entire life</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Orphan Black</h3>
<p>This is the best TV show ever in my life. If you like thrillers, crimes,
    science fiction or something like that, you should watch these series for sure.
    Tatiana Maslany who is the actor roled the main character acts more than 7 people in one show
    with different accents, appearances, and personalities on each person, which is so amazing.</p>

<h3>2. How To Get Away With Murder</h3>
<p>The genre of this series is thriller. If you love thrillers, crimes, and court stories
    at the same time, then you should definitely watch this series.
    Otherwise, you're stupid. lol </p>

<h3>3. Broadchurch</h3>
<p>This is a British drama. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman starring. I really liked this series
    because it showed the gloomy mood that the first one is reminded of when I think of the UK.
    I love how British shows describe crimes, the mood of itself, and their accents for sure :P</p>
